===================== Project description =====================

Hotel Management System. The system is a web application which would be used by hotel staff (receptionist) and administrator to manage user data 
and booking data of the hotel. The reason the system is made as web application instead of a desktop application is because it would be easy access, 
more flexible, centralized database, and better security. The data management would be handed by the hotel staff which would include all the 
functionalities of the system and the administrator would be overlooking these functions as well as handling the system and hotelâ€™s specifications. The 
interface is sleek and easy to understand saving training time. Since the system is cloud hosted, it can be accessed from anywhere using any device if user 
has access to the system. Making the system portable inside the premises to make it convenient to staff as well as customers. Although the system would 
function primarily as a front desk system, it would be able to handle all system related customer requirements through the system.
 
 The hotel staff (receptionist) would be mainly handling the customer management (front desk system). This includes adding a new customer to the 
system or retrieving registered customers and assigning a package to their requirements. The package consists of the booking data such as rooms, 
facilities, and amenities. Once package is chosen the extra facilities and amenities can be added on and the payment can be made. If the customer has 
any requirements during the stay the additional facilities can be provided accordingly. The system would also handle the checking out where a detailed 
receipt would be provided by the system. 
 The administrator would overlook all these functionalities as well as handling the data related to adding or removing users from the system, handling 
customer data if necessary, managing room data, managing package data, and handling the facilities and amenities.
